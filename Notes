- Began by setting up Github, did not set up specific email for signups, used my non-business email (gmail account).
- Github is to be used for reflections and keeping track of what has been worked on and in what order.
- I am to get used to taking notes of what I have done it real time while working on projects in this course.
- Set up Hypothesis account next, and joined HIST3814O group.
- Hypothesis will make citations easier, and will allow me to see what other people are citing, along with sometimes why.
- Have also read through the quick start guide for students to understand how to use hypothesis myself.
- Set up Zotero next, an app that will allow me to save and collect sources in order to easily cite them when ready.
- Read the Introduction to Zotero link to learn how to use it.
